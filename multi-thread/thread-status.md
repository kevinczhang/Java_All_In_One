# Thread status

![Thread status](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

1. synchronized keyword is used for exclusive accessing. 
2. To make a method synchronized, simply add the synchronized keyword to its declaration. Then no two invocations of synchronized methods on the same object can interleave with each other. 
3. Synchronized statements must specify the object that provides the intrinsic lock. When synchronized\(this\) is used, you have to avoid to synchronizing invocations of other objects' methods.
4. wait\(\) tells the calling thread to give up the monitor and go to sleep until some other thread enters the same monitor and calls notify\( \). notify\(\) wakes up the first thread that called wait\(\) on the same object.

```java
/**
 * {@code synchronized} ("only let one thread in here at a time".) and 
 * {@code join} ("wait until * thread on which join has called finished") keyword.
 */
public class Worker {

    private int count = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Worker worker = new Worker();
        worker.doWork();

    /**
     * Run code again by removing the synchronized and join keywords By removing
     * synchronized keyword count variable will vary that is it is not atomic in
     * this case due to the reason that count is shared between the threads or
