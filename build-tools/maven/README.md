# Maven

A build tool is a tool that automates everything related to building the software project. Building a software project typically includes one or more of these activities:

* Generating source code \(if auto-generated code is used in the project\).
* Generating documentation from the source code.
* Compiling source code.
* Packaging compiled code into JAR files or ZIP files.
* Installing the packaged code on a server, in a repository or somewhere else.

Any given software project may have more activities than these needed to build the finished software. Such activities can normally be plugged into a build tool, so these activities can be automated too.

The advantage of automating the build process is that you minimize the risk of humans making errors while building the software manually. Additionally, an automated build tool is typically faster than a human performing the same steps manually.

## Maven Overview - Core Concepts

Maven is centered around the concept of POM files \(Project Object Model\). Here is a diagram illustrating how Maven uses the POM file, and what the POM file primarily contains:

### **Dependencies and Repositories**

One of the first goals Maven executes is to check the dependencies needed by your project. Dependencies are external JAR files \(Java libraries\) that your project uses. If the dependencies are not found in the local Maven repository, Maven downloads them from a central Maven repository and puts them in your local repository. The local repository is just a directory on your computer's hard disk. You can specify where the local repository should be located if you want to \(I do\). You can also specify which remote repository to use for downloading dependencies. All this will be explained in more detail later in this tutorial.

### **Build Plugins**

Build plugins are used to insert extra goals into a build phase. If you need to perform a set of actions for your project which are not covered by the standard Maven build phases and goals, you can add a plugin to the POM file. Maven has some standard plugins you can use, and you can also implement your own in Java if you need to.

### **Build Profiles**

Build profiles are used if you need to build your project in different ways. For instance, you may need to build your project for your local computer, for development and test. And you may need to build it for deployment on your production environment. These two builds may be different. To enable different builds you can add different build profiles to your POM files. When executing Maven you can tell which build profile to use.

## Maven Settings File

Maven has two settings files. In the settings files you can configure settings for Maven across all Maven POM files. For instance, you can configure ****Location of local repository, Active build profile, Etc.

The settings files are called `settings.xml`. The two settings files are located at:

* The Maven installation directory: `$M2_HOME/conf/settings.xml`
* The user's home directory: `${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml`

## Maven Java Compiler Version

There are two ways to set the Java compiler version in a Maven POM file:

#### Via the Maven Java compiler properties.

```markup
<properties>
    <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
    <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
</properties>
```

#### Via the Maven Java compiler `plugin`.

```markup
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.6.1</version>
            <configuration>
                <source>1.8</source>
                <target>1.8</target>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

## Unit test

```text
mvn test
```

Runs the tests against the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed.

### Generating a Unit Test Report

The Maven unit test reports are generated by the Maven Surefire plugin. Therefore a unit test report is also some times referred to as surefire report.

You generate a Maven unit test report \(Surefire unit test report\) using the following Maven command:

```text
mvn surefire-report:report
```

The generated unit test report can be found in the `target/site` directory. The unit test report is named `surefire-report.html`. The path to the unit test report is thus:

```text
your-project/target/site/surefire-report.html
```

### Skipping the Tests

```text
mvn surefire-report:report-only
```
