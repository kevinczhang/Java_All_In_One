  Stream represents a sequence of objects from a source, which supports
  aggregate operations.

# Stream

* A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
* Streams donâ€™t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
* Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result, hence various intermediate operations can be pipelined. Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result.

##  **Intermediate Operations**

1. **map:** The map method is used to returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. `List number = Arrays.asList(2,3,4,5); List square = number.stream().map(x->x*x).collect(Collectors.toList());`
2. **filter:** The filter method is used to select elements as per the Predicate passed as argument. `List names = Arrays.asList("Reflection","Collection","Stream"); List result = names.stream().filter(s->s.startsWith("S")).collect(Collectors.toList());`
3. **sorted:** The sorted method is used to sort the stream. `List names = Arrays.asList("Reflection","Collection","Stream"); List result = names.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.toList());`

##  **Terminal Operations**

1. **collect:** The collect method is used to return the result of the intermediate operations performed on the stream. `List number = Arrays.asList(2,3,4,5,3); Set square = number.stream().map(x->x*x).collect(Collectors.toSet());`
2. **forEach:** The forEach method is used to iterate through every element of the stream. `List number = Arrays.asList(2,3,4,5); number.stream().map(x->x*x).forEach(y->System.out.println(y));`
3. **reduce:** The reduce method is used to reduce the elements of a stream to a single value.  
   The reduce method takes a BinaryOperator as a parameter.

   `List number = Arrays.asList(2,3,4,5);  
   int even = number.stream().filter(x->x%2==0).reduce(0,(ans,i)-> ans+i);`
