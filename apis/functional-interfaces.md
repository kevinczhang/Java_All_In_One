# Functional Interfaces

Functional Interface **permit exactly one abstract method inside them**. These interfaces are also called **Single Abstract Method interfaces \(SAM Interfaces\)**. In Java 8, functional interfaces can be represented using lambda expressions, method reference and constructor references as well.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface MyFirstFunctionalInterface 
{
    public void firstWork();
}
```
